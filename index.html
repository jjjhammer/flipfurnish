The amount of the reduction can, where appropriate, be up to the full amount of the Fees or charges.</li> 

<li unfuckable="on">In any case, regardless of events beyond our control, if we do not deliver the Goods on time, you can (in addition to any other remedies) treat the Contract at an end if:
<ol unfuckable="on">
    <li unfuckable="on">we have refused to deliver the Goods, or if delivery on time is essential taking into account all the relevant circumstances at the time the Contract was made, or you said to us before the Contract was made that delivery on time was essential; or</li>
    
    <li unfuckable="on">after we have failed to deliver on time, you have specified a later period which is appropriate to the circumstances and we have not delivered within that period.</li>

    </ol>
   </li> 


<li unfuckable="on">If you treat the Contract at an end, we will (in addition to other remedies) promptly return all payments made under the Contract.</li>
    
<li unfuckable="on">If you were entitled to treat the Contract at an end, but do not do so, you are not prevented from cancelling the Order for any Goods or rejecting Goods that have been delivered and, if you do this, we will (in addition to other remedies) without delay return all payments made under the Contract for any such cancelled or rejected Goods. If the Goods have been delivered, you must return them to us or allow us to collect them from you and we will pay the costs of this.</li>
    
<li unfuckable="on">If any Goods form a commercial unit (a unit is a commercial unit if division of the unit would materially impair the value of the goods or the character of the unit) you cannot cancel or reject the Order for some of those Goods without also cancelling or rejecting the Order for the rest of them.</li>
    
<li unfuckable="on">We do not generally deliver to addresses outside England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Channels Islands. If, however, we accept an Order for delivery outside that area, you may need to pay import duties or other taxes, as we will not pay them.</li>
    
<li unfuckable="on">You agree we may deliver the Goods in instalments if we suffer a shortage of stock or other genuine and fair reason, subject to the above provisions and provided you are not liable for extra charges.</li>
    
<li unfuckable="on">If you or your nominee fail, through no fault of ours, to take delivery of the  Services at the Delivery Location, we may charge the reasonable costs of storing and redelivering them.</li>
    
<li unfuckable="on">The Goods will become your responsibility from the completion of delivery or Customer collection. You must, if reasonably practicable, examine the Goods before accepting them.</li></ol>

<ol class="clauses" unfuckable="on">
<li unfuckable="on">Risk of damage to, or loss of, any Goods will pass to you when the Goods are delivered to you.</li> 
<li unfuckable="on">You do not own the Goods until we have received payment in full. If full payment is overdue or a step occurs towards your bankruptcy, we can choose, by notice to cancel any delivery and end any right to use the Goods still owned by you, in which case you must return them or allow us to collect them.

<li unfuckable="on">The Supplier does not exclude liability for: (i) any fraudulent act or omission; or (ii) death or personal injury caused by negligence or breach of the Supplier's other legal obligations.  Subject to this, we are not liable for (i) loss which was not reasonably foreseeable to both parties at the time when the Contract was made, or (ii) loss (eg loss of profit) to your business, trade, craft or profession which would not be suffered by a Consumer - because we believe you are not buying the Services and Goods wholly or mainly for your business, trade, craft or profession.

<h2 unfuckable="on">Governing law, jurisdiction and complaints</h2>
<ol class="clauses" unfuckable="on">
<li unfuckable="on">The Contract (including any non-contractual matters) is governed by the law of England and Wales.</li>

    </ol>
 

<h2 unfuckable="on"> Withdrawal  and cancellation</h2>
 <ol class="clauses" unfuckable="on">

<li unfuckable="on">You can withdraw the Order by telling us before the Contract is made, if you simply wish to change your mind and without giving us a reason, and without incurring any liability.</li>



<li unfuckable="on">This is a <b unfuckable="on">distance contract</b> (as defined below) which has the cancellation rights (<b unfuckable="on">Cancellation Rights</b>) set out below. These Cancellation Rights, however, do not apply, to a contract for the following goods and services (with no others) in the following circumstances:
<ol unfuckable="on">
                <li unfuckable="on">accommodation, transport of goods, vehicle rental services, catering or services related to leisure activities, if the contract provides for a specific date or period of performance;</li>
        <li unfuckable="on">goods that are made to your specifications or are clearly personalised;</li>
    <li unfuckable="on">goods which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly.</li>
    </ol>
        </li>
     
     
<p unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">Right to cancel</b></p> 

<li unfuckable="on">Subject as stated in these Terms and Conditions, you can cancel this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.</li>
<li unfuckable="on">The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party, other than the carrier, indicated by you, acquires physical possession of the last of the Goods.  In a contract for the supply of services only (without goods), the cancellation period will expire 14 days from the day the Contract was entered into. In a contract for the supply of goods over time (ie subscriptions), the right to cancel will be 14 days after the first delivery.</li>
<li unfuckable="on">To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel this Contract by a clear statement setting out your decision (eg a letter sent by post, fax or email).  You can use the attached model cancellation form, but it is not obligatory.  In any event, you must be able to show clear evidence of when the cancellation was made, so you may decide to use the model cancellation form.</li>
<li unfuckable="on">You can also electronically fill in and submit the model cancellation form or any other clear statement of the Customer's decision to cancel the Contract on our website  www.flipfurnish.com .  If you use this option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a cancellation in a Durable Medium (eg by email) without delay.</li>

<li unfuckable="on">To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.</li>  
    
<p unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">Commencement of Services in the cancellation period</b></p>

<li unfuckable="on">We must not begin the supply of a service (being part of the Services) before the end of the cancellation period unless you have made an express request for the service.</li>

<p unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">Effects of cancellation in the cancellation period</b></p>

<li unfuckable="on">Except as set out below, if you cancel this Contract, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (except for the supplementary costs arising if you chose a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us).</li>
   
        
<p unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">Payment for Services commenced during the cancellation period</b></p>


<li unfuckable="on">Where a service is supplied (being part of the Service) before the end of the cancellation period in response to your express request to do so, you must pay an amount for the supply of the service for the period for which it is supplied, ending with the time when we are informed of your decision to cancel the Contract. This amount is in proportion to what has been supplied in comparison with the full coverage of the Contract. This amount is to be calculated on the basis of the total price agreed in the Contract or, if the total price were to be excessive, on the basis of the market value of the service that has been supplied, calculated by comparing prices for equivalent services supplied by other traders.  You will bear no cost for supply of that service, in full or in part, in this cancellation period if that service is not supplied in response to such a request.</li>
    
<p unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">Deduction for Goods supplied</b></p>

 <li unfuckable="on">We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any Goods supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you (ie handling the Goods beyond what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Goods: eg it goes beyond the sort of handling that might be reasonably allowed in a shop).  This is because you are liable for that loss and, if that deduction is not made, you must pay us the amount of that loss.</li>
    
<p unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">Timing of reimbursement</b></p>

<li unfuckable="on">If we have not offered to collect the Goods, we will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than:
<ol unfuckable="on">
    <li unfuckable="on">14 days after the day we receive back from you any Goods supplied, or</li>
    <li unfuckable="on">(if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide evidence that you have sent back the Goods.</li>
         </ol></li>
<li unfuckable="on">If we have offered to collect the Goods or if no Goods were supplied or to be supplied (ie it is a contract for the supply of services only), we will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this Contract.</li>
<li unfuckable="on">We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.</li>
    
    
<p unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">Returning Goods</b></p>
    
<li unfuckable="on"> If you have received Goods in connection with the Contract which you have cancelled, you must send back the Goods or hand them over to us at
    




Silver Birches, Danesbury Park Road, Welwyn, Herts, AL6 9SS

    







  

    
    
 without delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate to us your cancellation of this Contract.  The deadline is met if you send back the Goods before the period of 14 days has expired.  You agree that you will have to bear the cost of returning the Goods.</li>
<li unfuckable="on">For the purposes of these Cancellation Rights, these words have the following meanings:
    <ol unfuckable="on">
        <li unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">distance contract</b> means a contract concluded between a trader and a consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication up to and including the time at which the contract is concluded;</li>
        <li unfuckable="on"><b unfuckable="on">sales contract</b> means a contract under which a trader transfers or agrees to transfer the ownership of goods to a consumer and the consumer pays or agrees to pay the price, including any contract that has both goods and services as its object.</li>
